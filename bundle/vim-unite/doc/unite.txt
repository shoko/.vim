==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*unite-introduction*

*unite* searches and displays information from arbitrary sources like files,
buffers, recently used files or registers. You can run one of defined action
on a target displayed.

The differences between |unite| and similar plugins like |fuzzyfinder| or |ku|
are that |unite| doesn't use the built-in completion interface of Vim, and
integrates sources at the same time.

==============================================================================
USAGE						*unite-usage*

	In case when you run with files and buffers as the source
>
	:Unite file buffer
<

	In case when you run with the initial input value foo
>
	:Unite -input=foo file
<

The unite you started splits the window horizontally as default, opening on
the top of the Vim.  For example,
>
	:Unite file
<
lists up the files of the current directory.  You may choose one of the
candidates by moving j or k, and typing Enter opens the candidate in a new
buffer.  That's the default action for candidates of which kind is file.  You
may also select an action with <Tab> on a candidate.  See also |unite-action|
about the actions.

You can narrow down the candidates with a keyword.  After opening a unite
window, the cursor goes on the right side of > in the 2nd line by typing i.
Then you can input a keyword to narrow down the candidates.  Each single
characters you type narrows down the candidates.  You also can use a wild
card * as an arbitrary character sequence.  For example
>
	*hisa
<
matches hisa, ujihisa, or ujihisahisa.  Furthermore, two consequence wild cards
matches directory recursively.  For example
>
	**/foo
<
matches bar/foo or buzz/bar/foo.  Note that you should consider using
|file_rec| that will be described bellow in most cases.

You may specify multiple keywords to narrow down, separating by spaces.
>
	foo bar
<
That matches candidates that match both foo and bar.

You may specify negative conditions with !.
>
	foo !bar
<
That matches foo but candidates that match bar will be rejected.

	You may add wild cards automatically with / if you specify files on
	-buffer-name option.  That's handy in case you select file with unite.

	:Unite -buffer-name=files file

See also |unite_default_key_mappings|for other actions.

==============================================================================
INSTALL						*unite-install*

Install the distributed files into Vim script directory which is usually
~/.vim/, or $HOME/vimfiles on Windows.

In future VimJolts the Vim plugin package manager will support unite, you can
install unite just by `jolt install unite`.

You may run unite with |:Unite| command with source as parameters if you
succeeded in installing unite.  However, it's pain in ass to run the command
explicitly every time, so I recommend you to set a key mapping for the
command.

==============================================================================
INTERFACE					*unite-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS 					*unite-commands*

:Unite [{options}] {sources}			*:Unite*
		Shows the candidate window of {sources} with empty initial
		narrowing text.  You may specify multiple {sources} with
		spaces as a separator; the order of the {sources} will be the
		order of candidates.  See |unite-source| also for sources.

		In case you are already on unite buffer, the narrowing text
		will be stored.

		You may give a list of strings, separating with :, after the
		name of sources. You must escape : and \ with \ for parameters
		themselves.  It depends on the sources how the parameters will
		be interpreted.

		Examples:
		"file:foo:bar": the parameters of source file are [foo, bar].
		"file:foo\:bar": the parameters of source file are [foo:bar].

		{options} are options for a unite buffer.  You may give the
		following parameters for a option; you must escape with \ when
		it contains spaces.

		-buffer-name={buffer-name}
		Specifies a buffer name. You can share a configuration of
		functions like |unite#set_substitute_pattern()| by giving a
		buffer name for unite buffers that have same purpose.
		The default buffer name is 'default'.

		-input={input-text}
		Specifies an initial narrowing text. The default value is ''.

		-prompt={prompt-text}
		Specifies a prompt. The default value is '> '.

		-default-action={default-action}
		Specifies a default action. The default value is 'default'.

		-start-insert
		Opens unite with narrowing mode. Otherwise the initial mode
		will be Normal mode.

:UniteWithCurrentDir [-buffer-name={buffer-name}] [-input={input-text}] {sources}
						*:UniteWithCurrentDir*
		Unite all sources. Initial narrowing text is current directory.

:UniteWithBufferDir [-buffer-name={buffer-name}] [-input={input-text}] {sources}
						*:UniteWithBufferDir*
		Unite all sources. Initial narrowing text is current buffer
		directory.

:UniteWithCursorWord [-buffer-name={buffer-name}] [-input={input-text}] {sources}
						*:UniteWithCursorWord*
		Unite all sources. Initial narrowing text is cursor word.
